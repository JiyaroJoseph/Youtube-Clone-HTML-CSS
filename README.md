A simple and responsive clone of the YouTube homepage built using only HTML and CSS. This project was created as a front-end design practice to improve my skills in layout structuring, responsive design, and modern CSS techniques. It's fully responsive across devices and closely mimics YouTubeâ€™s visual structure.
